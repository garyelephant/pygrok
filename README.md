A Python library to parse strings and extract information from structured/unstructured data

What can I use Grok for?
------------------------
* parsing and matching patterns in a string(log, message etc.)
* relieving from complex regular expressions.
* extracting information from structured/unstructured data

Installation
------------

```Bash
    $ pip install pygrok
```

or download, uncompress and install pygrok from [here](https://github.com/garyelephant/pygrok/releases/latest):

```Bash
    $ tar zxvf pygrok-xx.tar.gz
    $ cd pygrok_dir
    $ sudo python setup.py install
```

Getting Started
---------------
```Python
from pygrok import Grok
text = 'gary is male, 25 years old and weighs 68.5 kilograms'
pattern = '%{WORD:name} is %{WORD:gender}, %{NUMBER:age} years old and weighs %{NUMBER:weight} kilograms'
grok = Grok(pattern)
print grok.match(text)

# {'gender': 'male', 'age': '25', 'name': 'gary', 'weight': '68.5'}
```

Pretty Cool !

Numbers can be converted from string to `int` or `float` if you use `%{pattern:name:type}` syntax, such as `%{NUMBER:age:int}`
```Python
from pygrok import Grok
text = 'gary is male, 25 years old and weighs 68.5 kilograms'
pattern = '%{WORD:name} is %{WORD:gender}, %{NUMBER:age:int} years old and weighs %{NUMBER:weight:float} kilograms'
grok = Grok(pattern)
print grok.match(text)

# {'gender': 'male', 'age': 25, 'name': 'gary', 'weight': 68.5}
```
Now `age` is of type `int` and `weight` is of type `float`.

Awesome !

Some of the pattern you can use are listed here:
```
`WORD` means \b\w+\b in regular expression.
`NUMBER` means (?:%{BASE10NUM})
`BASE10NUM` means (?<![0-9.+-])(?>[+-]?(?:(?:[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?)|(?:\.[0-9]+)))

other patterns such as `IP`, `HOSTNAME`, `URIPATH`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP_ISO8601`, `COMMONAPACHELOG`..
```
See All patterns [here](./pygrok/patterns)

You can also have custom pattern, see [these codes](https://github.com/garyelephant/pygrok/blob/master/tests/test_pygrok.py#L97).


More details
------------
Beause python re module does not support regular expression syntax atomic grouping(?>),so pygrok requires [regex](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex/2014.06.28) to be installed.

pygrok is inspired by [Grok](https://github.com/jordansissel/grok) developed by Jordan Sissel.
This is not a wrapper of Jordan Sissel's Grok and totally implemented by me.

Grok is a simple software that allows you to easily parse strings, logs and other files. With grok, you can turn unstructured log and event data into structured data.Pygrok does the same thing.

I recommend you to have a look at [logstash filter grok](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html), it explains how Grok-like thing work.

pattern files come from [logstash filter grok's pattern files](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/tree/master/patterns)
